            <li><b>Beer Taster</b>
                <p>I started trying beers I had never seen before. And found that it had a strange taste.It tastes different from the beer sold at supermarkets.
                    It was the starting point for me to start exploring new beers that I had never had before.In order to taste and enjoy those beers.
                    That's how I got to know about craft beer and craft beer events and became fascinated with it.
                </p>

            <li><b>Watch Soccer game</b>
                <p>(I would like to use the word soccer instead of football to avoid confusion.)<br />
                    I love soccer very much. I'm a Chelsea fan. Even though I didn't grow up in London. Scoocer is a very fun sport.
                    Whether as a player or a spectator. It can keep us smiling all day long and irritated all day long when the game is over.
                    But no matter how sad or frustrated you are with the results of the competition, In the end, we still continue to cheer for the team we love.

            </li>
            <li><b>Play Poker</b>
                <p>It's not gambling. But it is a sport that requires considerable skill. I dream that after I retire I'm going to be a poker player.
                    It is a sport that requires more brain power than emotion or strength. I hope I can get a royal straight flush sometime.

            </li>
            <li><b>Travel</b>
                <p>I like to take the opportunity to put myself out there. Go to the beach, mountains, shopping malls or even find the food I want to eat.
                    It may sound tiring. But I also really like it.
